# SafeErasePro - NIST SP 800-88r2 Compliance Guide

## Overview

SafeErasePro has been fully updated to comply with NIST Special Publication 800-88r2, "Guidelines for Media Sanitization." This document outlines how the software implements each required NIST guideline.

## NIST Compliance Implementation

### Section 1: Core Wiping Methods

#### Rule 1.1: Clear Method Implementation ✅
- **What it is**: Clear uses software to overwrite data, protecting against simple data recovery methods
- **Implementation**: 
  - Single-pass overwrite (NIST recommends against multi-pass methods)
  - Warning displayed for SSD limitations (spare storage areas may not be reached)
  - Appropriate for low-sensitivity data staying in physical control

#### Rule 1.2: Purge Method Implementation ✅
- **What it is**: Purge uses advanced techniques to make data recovery infeasible even with lab equipment
- **Implementation**:
  - SSD Secure Erase: Uses drive's built-in sanitization commands
  - Cryptographic Erase: Erases encryption keys to make data unreadable
  - Automatic technique selection based on device type and encryption status

#### Rule 1.3: Destroy Method Recommendation ✅
- **What it is**: Physical destruction makes data recovery impossible
- **Implementation**:
  - Software cannot physically destroy drives
  - Provides detailed recommendations for physical destruction methods
  - Suggests certified destruction services and proper documentation

### Section 2: AI Engine and User Guidance

#### Rule 2.1: NIST Decision Flowchart ✅
- **Implementation**: Complete AI-guided decision process
- **Questions asked**:
  1. Will the drive be reused?
  2. What is the data sensitivity level (Low, Moderate, High)?
  3. Will the drive leave your physical control?
- **Decision logic**: Follows official NIST flowchart for method selection

#### Rule 2.2: Cryptographic Erase Rules ✅
- **Safety checks**:
  - Warns against CE if data was saved before encryption was enabled
  - Recommends CE only if drive was always encrypted from the start
  - Validates encryption status before allowing CE

### Section 3: Verification and Checking

#### Rule 3.1: Sanitization Verification ✅
- **Implementation**:
  - Checks completion status from drive after wipe commands
  - Reports errors and problems to user
  - Verifies successful completion before marking as complete

#### Rule 3.2: Method Validation ✅
- **Implementation**:
  - Warns users about inappropriate method choices
  - Validates device compatibility with chosen techniques
  - Provides guidance on better alternatives

### Section 4: Digital Certificate Rules

#### Rule 4.1: Required Certificate Fields ✅
All NIST-required fields are included in certificates:

**Required Fields:**
- ✅ Manufacturer
- ✅ Model
- ✅ Serial Number
- ✅ Media Type (e.g., magnetic, flash memory)
- ✅ Sanitization Method (Clear, Purge, Destroy)
- ✅ Sanitization Technique (Overwrite, Crypto Erase, etc.)
- ✅ Tool Used (SafeErasePro and version number)
- ✅ Verification Method (e.g., status check)
- ✅ Person's Name, Title, and Date

**Additional Fields:**
- Device Path
- Device Size
- Verification Status
- Completion Time
- Certificate ID
- NIST Compliance Statement

## Usage Examples

### CLI Interface
```bash
# Run NIST-compliant CLI
python main.py cli

# The system will:
# 1. Display available devices
# 2. Run NIST decision flowchart
# 3. Execute appropriate sanitization method
# 4. Verify completion
# 5. Generate NIST-compliant certificate
```

### Web Interface
```bash
# Run NIST-compliant web GUI
python main.py web

# Access at http://localhost:5000
# Features:
# - Device selection
# - NIST compliance settings form
# - AI-guided method selection
# - Real-time progress tracking
# - NIST-compliant certificate generation
```

## NIST Decision Process

The software implements the official NIST decision flowchart:

1. **Will the drive be reused?**
   - No → Recommend DESTROY method
   - Yes → Continue to next question

2. **What is the data sensitivity level?**
   - Low + Stays in control → CLEAR method
   - Low + Leaves control → PURGE method
   - Moderate/High → PURGE method

3. **Will the drive leave physical control?**
   - Yes → PURGE method required
   - No → Method depends on sensitivity

## Compliance Verification

### Certificate Verification
```bash
# Verify NIST-compliant certificate
python main.py verify

# Checks:
# - Digital signature validity
# - NIST field completeness
# - Compliance statement accuracy
```
